description: Build with confidence using the AkibaPamoja APIs
---

Welcome to the AkibaPamoja API. This page helps you get productive fast: set up authentication, make your first request, and understand responses and errors.

What you'll do in ~5 minutes:
- Configure your API key
- Create your first contribution
- Inspect the response and handle errors

## Prerequisites
- An AkibaPamoja account and API key from your dashboard
- A terminal with curl or a language runtime (Node.js 18+ or Python 3.9+)
- The API base URL for your environment

> Tip: Keep secrets out of source control. Use environment variables or a secure secret manager in development and CI.

## Authentication
All requests use Bearer auth via the Authorization header.

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Quickstart
Create a contribution with a single request.

<div className="mt-4 rounded-xl border border-[#4B189B] bg-black/50 shadow-[0_0_50px_-10px_rgba(75,24,155,0.6)]">
  <div className="flex items-center justify-between border-b border-white/10 px-4 sm:px-6 py-3">
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
      <div className="size-2.5 rounded-full bg-[#EF4444]" />
      <div className="size-2.5 rounded-full bg-[#EAB308]" />
      <div className="size-2.5 rounded-full bg-[#22C55E]" />
    </div>
    <span className="text-xs sm:text-sm text-white/80">POST /contributions/</span>
  </div>
</div>

### cURL
```bash
curl -X POST "$AKIBA_BASE_URL/contributions/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AKIBA_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "memberId": "mem_123",
    "amount": 1000,
    "currency": "KES",
    "notes": "October 2025 cycle"
  }'
```

### JavaScript (Node.js / TypeScript)
```ts
const res = await fetch(`${process.env.AKIBA_BASE_URL}/contributions/`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.AKIBA_API_KEY}`,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    memberId: "mem_123",
    amount: 1000,
    currency: "KES",
    notes: "October 2025 cycle",
  }),
});

if (!res.ok) {
  const err = await res.text();
  throw new Error(`Request failed (${res.status}): ${err}`);
}

const contribution = await res.json();
console.log(contribution.id);
```

### Python (requests)
```py
import os
import requests

resp = requests.post(
    url=f"{os.environ['AKIBA_BASE_URL']}/contributions/",
    headers={
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {os.environ['AKIBA_API_KEY']}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    json={
        "memberId": "mem_123",
        "amount": 1000,
        "currency": "KES",
        "notes": "October 2025 cycle",
    },
)

resp.raise_for_status()
print(resp.json())
```

### Example success response
```json
{
  "id": "ctrb_01J9VK0YZS5Y8K3H4A8Z7WQ2NQ",
  "memberId": "mem_123",
  "amount": 1000,
  "currency": "KES",
  "status": "succeeded",
  "createdAt": "2025-10-04T20:10:22Z"
}
```

- id: Unique identifier for the contribution
- status: Current processing state (e.g., pending, succeeded, failed)

## Handling errors
AkibaPamoja uses standard HTTP status codes. On errors, the response includes an error object.

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_request",
    "message": "memberId is required",
    "requestId": "req_01J9VJZ8B9T7X4"
  }
}
```

- 400 Bad Request: Your parameters are invalid
- 401 Unauthorized: Your API key is missing or incorrect
- 403 Forbidden: The key doesn't have access to the resource
- 404 Not Found: The resource doesn't exist
- 409 Conflict: A resource already exists or state conflict
- 429 Too Many Requests: You have hit a rate limit; respect the Retry-After header
- 5xx: Temporary server error; retry with exponential backoff

> Tip: Log the requestId returned in error responses to help Support locating requests quickly.

## Pagination and filtering
List endpoints return many items. Use query parameters like limit and offset (or cursors) to page through results, and filter parameters to narrow the response. Always prefer server-side filtering to reduce payload size and latency.

## Going further
- Explore the endpoints in the left navigation when you're ready to go deeper
- Use sandbox credentials in development; swap to live keys only when you are ready to go live
- Keep your integration idempotent for create operations to avoid duplicate submissions

If you get stuck, open a ticket from your dashboard with the requestId and timestamp, and we'll help you get unblocked quickly.
